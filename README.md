In this project, I have written a program that will use the exponential smoothing to help you predict a value in the future (e.g future stock).  In addition, the program comes up with the linear regression equation to predict the same value as was done in exponential smoothing.  Overview Use forecasting today to optimize for tomorrow! Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. It is one of the prime tools of any business analyst used to predict demand and inventory, budgeting, sales quotas, marketing campaigns, and procurement. Accurate forecasts lead to better decisions. Current visual implements well known exponential smoothing method for the forecasting. The prediction is based on trend and seasonality modeling. You can control the algorithm parameters and the visual attributes to suit your needs.
